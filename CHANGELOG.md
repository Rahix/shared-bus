## [Unreleased]


## [0.2.4] - 2022-06-16
### Added
- Added support for the I2C traits from the `embedded-hal` alpha 8 version
  (`eh-alpha` feature flag) ([#36]).

### Fixed
- Fixed the `atomic-polyfill` dependency being pulled in even in cases where it
  is not used.
- Fixed a problem with the ADC sharing `embedded-hal` dependency.

[#36]: https://github.com/Rahix/shared-bus/pull/36


## [0.2.3] - 2022-03-05
### Added
- A mutex type for Xtensa LX6 micorontrollers (e.g. ESP32) ([#22]).
- A proxy type for sharing an ADC to allow "concurrently" reading its channels
  from multiple tasks ([#24]).
- Support for thumbv6 targets by using `atomic-polyfill` instead of libcore
  atomics ([#30]).
- I2cProxy and AdcProxy joined into single type Proxy ([#25])

## [0.2.2] - 2021-04-20
### Changed
- Updated the documentation on how to use `shared-bus` with RTIC.
- Removed superfluous trait bounds on the types - the trait bounds are really
  only necessary on the `impl`-blocks.

### Fixed
- Fixed the `Clone` implementations from 0.2.1 being useless due to an
  unnecessary trait bound.


## [0.2.1] - 2021-04-20
### Added
- Added a new "Mutex" and bus-manager for compatibility with RTIC.  Check the
  documentation for the `BusManagerAtomicCheck` for details.

### Changed
- `I2cProxy` and `SpiProxy` now implement `Clone`.  Cloning a proxy might be
  useful if a driver wants to split bus access up even further internally
  without wrapping the bus-proxy in another bus-manager.


## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-24
Complete rework of the crate, most items have changed at least slightly.
Please read the updated documentation to understand how the new version
works.

### Added
- A `BusMutexSimple` for sharing within a single task/thread with minimal
  overhead.
- Macros for instanciating a 'global' bus manager which lives for `'static`.

### Changed
- The `BusMutex` trait's `lock()` method now passes `&mut` to the closure,
  removing the `RefCell` from the manager.
- The generic parameter of `BusMutex` was moved into an associated type.
- Instead of a single proxy-type for everything, separate proxy types were
  introduced, to allow different constraints on their creation.

### Fixed
- The SPI proxy is now `!Send` to make sure it can only be used from
  within a single thread/task.


## 0.1.4 - 2018-11-04
