//! **shared-bus** is a crate to allow sharing bus peripherals safely between multiple devices.
//!
//! In the `embedded-hal` ecosystem, it is convention for drivers to "own" the bus peripheral they
//! are operating on.  This implies that only _one_ driver can have access to a certain bus.  That,
//! of course, poses an issue when multiple devices are connected to a single bus.
//!
//! _shared-bus_ solves this by giving each driver a bus-proxy to own which internally manages
//! access to the actual bus in a safe manner.  For a more in-depth introduction of the problem
//! this crate is trying to solve, take a look at the [blog post][blog-post].
//!
//! There are different 'bus managers' for different use-cases:
//!
//! # Sharing within a single task/thread
//! As long as all users of a bus are contained in a single task/thread, bus sharing is very
//! simple.  With no concurrency possible, no special synchronization is needed.  This is where
//! a [`BusManagerSimple`] should be used:
//!
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal::blocking::i2c;
//! # use embedded_hal::blocking::i2c::Write as _;
//! # struct MyDevice<T>(T);
//! # impl<T: i2c::Write> MyDevice<T> {
//! #     pub fn new(t: T) -> Self { MyDevice(t) }
//! #     pub fn do_something_on_the_bus(&mut self) {
//! #         self.0.write(0xab, &[0x00]);
//! #     }
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn _example(i2c: impl i2c::Write) {
//! // For example:
//! // let i2c = I2c::i2c1(dp.I2C1, (scl, sda), 90.khz(), clocks, &mut rcc.apb1);
//!
//! let bus = shared_bus::BusManagerSimple::new(i2c);
//!
//! let mut proxy1 = bus.acquire_i2c();
//! let mut my_device = MyDevice::new(bus.acquire_i2c());
//!
//! proxy1.write(0x39, &[0xc0, 0xff, 0xee]);
//! my_device.do_something_on_the_bus();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The `BusManager::acquire_*()` methods can be called as often as needed; each call will yield
//! a new bus-proxy of the requested type.
//!
//! # Sharing across multiple tasks/threads
//! For sharing across multiple tasks/threads, synchronization is needed to ensure all bus-accesses
//! are strictly serialized and can't race against each other.  The synchronization is handled by
//! a platform-specific [`BusMutex`] implementation.  _shared-bus_ already contains some
//! implementations for common targets.  For each one, there is also a macro for easily creating
//! a bus-manager with `'static` lifetime, which is almost always a requirement when sharing across
//! task/thread boundaries.  As an example:
//!
//! ```
//! # struct MyDevice<T>(T);
//! # impl<T> MyDevice<T> {
//! #     pub fn new(t: T) -> Self { MyDevice(t) }
//! #     pub fn do_something_on_the_bus(&mut self) { }
//! # }
//! #
//! # struct SomeI2cBus;
//! # let i2c = SomeI2cBus;
//! // For example:
//! // let i2c = I2c::i2c1(dp.I2C1, (scl, sda), 90.khz(), clocks, &mut rcc.apb1);
//!
//! // The bus is a 'static reference -> it lives forever and references can be
//! // shared with other threads.
//! let bus: &'static _ = shared_bus::new_std!(SomeI2cBus = i2c).unwrap();
//!
//! let mut proxy1 = bus.acquire_i2c();
//! let mut my_device = MyDevice::new(bus.acquire_i2c());
//!
//! // We can easily move a proxy to another thread:
//! # let t =
//! std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!     my_device.do_something_on_the_bus();
//! });
//! # t.join().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Those platform-specific bits are guarded by a feature that needs to be enabled.  Here is an
//! overview of what's already available:
//!
//! | Mutex | Bus Manager | `'static` Bus Macro | Feature Name |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `std::sync::Mutex` | [`BusManagerStd`] | [`new_std!()`] | `std` |
//! | `cortex_m::interrupt::Mutex` | [`BusManagerCortexM`] | [`new_cortexm!()`] | `cortex-m` |
//! | None (Automatically Managed) | [`BusManagerAtomicCheck`] | [`new_atomic_check!()`] | `cortex-m` |
//!
//! # Supported Busses
//! Currently, the following busses can be shared with _shared-bus_:
//!
//! | Bus | Proxy Type | Acquire Method | Comments |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | I2C | [`I2cProxy`] | [`.acquire_i2c()`] | |
//! | SPI | [`SpiProxy`] | [`.acquire_spi()`] | SPI can only be shared within a single task (See [`SpiProxy`] for details). |

/// ## Warning
/// If devices on the same shared bus are not treated as a singular resource, it is possible that

/// ## Usage
/// In order to use this manager with a concurrency framework such as RTIC, all devices on the

/// In order to use this with RTIC (as an example), all devices on the shared bus must be stored in

/// struct Device<T> { _bus: T };
/// struct OtherDevice<T> { _bus: T };
